Citizens have internalized the legitimacy of the regime, and even the opposition is loyal: it loses elections rather than revolting. This phase is what most political theory assumes but few entities sustain for long. Fukuyama's critical insight is that mature stability contains its own decay mechanism: successful institutions breed complacency, elites begin treating institutions as resources to capture rather than frameworks to maintain, and what he calls \"repatrimonialization\" — the return of personalized, patronage-based politics — sets in from within.",

    theory: "A single actor or small group has eliminated rival power centers. The state apparatus is personalized — institutions exist but serve the ruler rather than the rule. Svolik identifies the two fundamental problems all autocracies must navigate: authoritarian control (managing threats from the population) and authoritarian power-sharing (managing threats from the elite coalition). Because no independent authority can enforce agreements, violence is the ever-present final arbiter. This phase can be surprisingly stable, but stability is purchased at the cost of adaptability: information reaching the leadership is systematically distorted, succession is existentially dangerous, and problem-solving capacity degrades while coercive capacity remains high.",

    theory: "The polity's costs are outrunning its capacity to sustain them — military overextension, fiscal crisis, elite fracture, demographic pressure, or accumulated legitimacy deficits. This is the most diagnostically important phase because nearly every polity passes through it; what matters is whether institutions are robust enough to redirect the trajectory without rupture. The strain phase is self-amplifying: fiscal stress forces service cuts, which erode legitimacy, which increases dissent, which requires more coercive spending, which deepens fiscal stress. Goldstone's structural model identifies the three simultaneous conditions that tip strain into crisis: state revenue crisis, elite fragmentation, and a mobilizable popular base — each necessary, none sufficient alone.",

    theory: "Institutions bend without breaking. The polity absorbs a shock (economic, demographic, military, or legitimacy-based) and emerges with new rules, new coalitions, or redistributed power. This is the rarest and most undertheorized path, and it requires two simultaneous conditions that are difficult to achieve together: elite willingness to bear short-term losses, and credible popular pressure sufficient to make reform necessary. Hirschman's framework explains the mechanism: when exit is unavailable or costly, voice becomes the rational strategy — reform happens precisely when the credible alternative is something worse. Without that threat, elites have no incentive to absorb reform costs.",

The system becomes brittle: coercive capacity remains high while problem-solving and adaptive capacity collapses. Levitsky and Ziblatt document the mechanism in democratic contexts — the erosion of mutual toleration and institutional forbearance — but the same dynamic operates in autocracies with greater finality: once the reform faction is eliminated, only external shock or elite defection can produce change.

Critically, this phase does not represent zero on all axes: legitimacy does not disappear, it fragments across rival claimants; coercive capacity often persists in localized form long after administrative capacity has collapsed; and distribution sometimes increases as the collapsing regime throws resources at constituencies to buy loyalty.

Max Weber's three types — traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal — are the foundation of almost all subsequent work. The core idea, that durable power requires voluntary compliance and not just coercion, is as close to consensus as political science gets. Seymour Martin Lipset formalized it empirically in the 1950s–60s.</p>
<p>A government can hold power through fear alone, but coercion is expensive and brittle. Legitimacy is what converts raw power into authority — the population's acceptance that the regime has a <em>right</em> to rule, not merely the capacity to enforce.</p>
<p><strong>Scale (0–5):</strong> 0 = pure coercion, no voluntary compliance; 5 = broad, cross-factional acceptance of the regime's right to rule.</p>`
  },
  capacity: {
    title: "Capacity",
    body: `<p>Capacity comes primarily from the state-building literature — Charles Tilly's war-makes-states thesis, Francis Fukuyama's work on political order, and the "failed states" research that expanded after the Cold War (Robert Rotberg and others). The basic insight: legitimacy without capacity is an empty shell. A government can be beloved and still unable to deliver security, collect taxes, or enforce contracts.</p>
<p>There is ongoing debate about whether capacity is one thing or several. Coercive capacity (monopoly on violence), administrative capacity (bureaucratic reach), and fiscal capacity (ability to tax and spend) are meaningfully different and don't always move together.</p>
<p><strong>Scale (0–5):</strong> 0 = state cannot execute basic functions; 5 = high administrative, fiscal, and coercive capacity operating in tandem.</p>`
  },
  distribution: {
    title: "Distribution",
    body: `<p>Distribution is the most contested axis. It draws from several traditions that don't fully agree: Mancur Olson's logic of collective action, Acemoglu and Robinson's framework of inclusive vs. extractive institutions (<em>Why Nations Fail</em>), and older structural traditions about who the state ultimately serves.</p>
<p>The empirical record supports the basic claim that highly extractive regimes are less stable long-term, but causal mechanisms are disputed. The concept is also genuinely ambiguous — distribution of <em>what</em>? Wealth? Public services? Political voice? Rights? These don't always move together, and different theoretical traditions weight them differently.</p>
<p><strong>Scale (0–5):</strong> 0 = highly extractive, benefits concentrated in a small elite; 5 = broadly shared benefits across social groups.</p>`
